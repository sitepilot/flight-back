# Flight

Flight provides Docker powered production runtimes and a (local) development environment for WordPress and Laravel that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Flight. Flight's simple CLI means you can start building your application without any previous Docker experience.

#### Inspiration
Sitepilot Flight is inspired by and derived from Laravel Sail (https://github.com/laravel/sail).
